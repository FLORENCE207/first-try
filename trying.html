    <h1> fashion news </h1>
    <p>Melbourne Royal Show organisers have been forced to belatedly order one of its clothing vendors to remove
        counterfeit clothing from their stall after an Australia fashion brand accused them of ripping off its label.
    </p>
    <p>But streetwear brand Geedup Clothing – which has been tracking the clothing seller and others across local
        markets and the national show circuit – said the show organisers had ignored warnings it sent them in advance of
        the event. It has also demanded the vendor be permanently banned.</p>

    <h1>rift over counterfeit clothing</h1> 
    <p>Show organisers said the counterfeit clothing was removed from the exhibitor’s stall this week – on the sixth day
        of the event.

    </p>
    <p>The Sydney streetwear brand had been issuing legal threats against vendors that sell replica items after it
        discovered fake Geedup-labelled items were being sold at the Sydney Royal Easter Show in April.
